8. How would you optimize the use of tuples as dictionary keys in a multi-threaded application?
9. How can you handle edge cases when using complex tuples (e.g., tuples with floating-point numbers) as dictionary keys?
10. How would you ensure efficient key retrieval when using tuples as dictionary keys in large-scale systems?
