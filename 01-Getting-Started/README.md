## 1.1 Introduction
- **1.1.1 Introduction to Python**
  
  - History & Origins
  
        Python is a widely used high-level programming language for general-purpose programming, created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Python features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management and supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative, functional programming, and procedural styles. It has a large and comprehensive standard library
        
        Two major versions of Python are currently in active use:
        Python 3.x is the current version and is under active development.
        Python 2.x is the legacy version and will receive only security updates until 2020. No new features will be
        implemented. Note that many projects still use Python 2, although migrating to Python 3 is getting easier

        You can download and install either version of Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). See Python 3 vs. Python 2 for a comparison between them. In addition, some third-parties offer re-packaged versions of Python that add commonly used libraries and other features to ease setup
        for common use cases, such as math, data analysis or scientific use. See [the list at the official site](https://www.python.org/download/alternatives/)
