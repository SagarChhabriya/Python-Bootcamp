### **14.3 Unit Converter**

#### **Objective:**
Create a **Unit Converter** that allows users to convert between different units (length, weight, temperature), based on user input, and displays the result.

---

### **Flow of the Unit Converter:**

1. **Menu Selection:**
   - Display a main menu where the user selects the conversion type: length, weight, or temperature.
   - Each category will have a sub-menu for selecting specific units (e.g., km to miles, kg to pounds, Celsius to Fahrenheit).

2. **User Input:**
   - Prompt the user to enter the value to be converted.
   - Prompt the user to choose the unit to convert from and the unit to convert to.

3. **Conversion Logic:**
   - Based on the selected units, apply the corresponding conversion formula:
     - Length (e.g., kilometers to miles).
     - Weight (e.g., kilograms to pounds).
     - Temperature (e.g., Celsius to Fahrenheit).
   
4. **Displaying the Result:**
   - Show the converted value to the user.

5. **Error Handling:**
   - Ensure input is valid (e.g., numeric values and valid units).
   - Handle invalid inputs gracefully by prompting the user to re-enter valid data.

6. **Repeat or Exit:**
   - After conversion, offer the user the option to perform another conversion or exit the program.
