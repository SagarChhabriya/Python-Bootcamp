### **Rock Paper Scissors Game:**

1. **Game Introduction:**
   - The game starts by introducing the rules of **Rock Paper Scissors** to the user, explaining the valid choices: "rock", "paper", or "scissors".
   - The user is asked to choose how many rounds they would like to play.

2. **Round Initialization:**
   - The game enters a loop where each round starts by displaying the current round number.
   - A score tracker is initialized to keep track of the user's score and the computer’s score, starting from zero.

3. **User Input:**
   - The user is prompted to input their choice from the valid options: "rock", "paper", or "scissors".
   - The input is validated to ensure that it matches one of the three valid choices. If the input is invalid (e.g., a typo or an unsupported option), the user is notified and prompted again to enter a valid choice.

4. **Computer Input:**
   - After the user’s choice, the computer randomly selects one of the valid choices: "rock", "paper", or "scissors". This is done using a random function to simulate a fair and unpredictable choice for the computer.

5. **Displaying Choices:**
   - Once both the user and the computer have made their selections, the game displays both choices, e.g., “You chose rock” and “Computer chose paper”.

6. **Determining the Winner:**
   - The game then compares the user’s and computer’s choices:
     - If the user’s and computer’s choices are the same, it’s a **tie**.
     - If the user’s choice beats the computer’s (e.g., rock beats scissors), the user wins the round.
     - If the computer’s choice beats the user’s (e.g., paper beats rock), the computer wins the round.

7. **Updating Scores:**
   - Based on the result of the round, the corresponding score (either for the user or for the computer) is incremented.
   - The current scores are displayed after each round.

8. **Repeat the Rounds:**
   - The game continues for the number of rounds specified at the start. After each round, the next round starts with the updated score.

9. **Game End and Final Result:**
   - Once all rounds are completed, the game ends, and the final score is displayed.
   - If the user has more wins than the computer, the game announces the user as the winner. If the computer has more wins, it declares the computer as the winner. If both have equal wins, it’s a **tie game**.
   
10. **Option to Play Again (Optional):**
   - At the end of the game, the user may be asked if they want to play again. If yes, the game resets and starts from the beginning. If no, the game ends.
